# Photo Upload Preview Hotfix - 2025-10-13

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Photo Preview Not Showing (CSP Violation)
**Problem**: Blob URLs blocked by Content Security Policy
```
Refused to load the image 'blob:https://cosmo-management.cloud/...' 
because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "img-src 'self' data: https:".
```

**Fix**: Updated CSP in `api/enhanced_security_middleware.py`
```python
# Before
"img-src 'self' data: https:; "

# After  
"img-src 'self' data: https: blob:; "
```

**Impact**: Photo previews now display correctly when uploading

### 2. ✅ Duplicate Variable Declaration
**Problem**: `touchStartX` declared twice causing SyntaxError
```
Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'touchStartX' has already been declared
```

**Fix**: Removed duplicate declaration in `api/templates/staff/base.html`
- Line 810: First declaration (for secret message swipe)
- Line 927: Removed duplicate, now reuses variable from line 810
- Added `{ passive: true }` for better mobile performance

**Impact**: No more JavaScript errors, improved touch gesture handling

### 3. ⚠️ 404 Image Error (Existing Issue)
**Problem**: One image returns 404
```
GET https://res.cloudinary.com/dz5jblgfs/image/upload/v1/media/task_images/34/94706c1949a741a2a1c280aea802940d_aarejn 404
```

**Status**: This is a data issue - the image was deleted from Cloudinary but the database record still exists.

**Recommendation**: Run cleanup command:
```bash
python manage.py cleanup_broken_photos --dry-run
python manage.py cleanup_broken_photos  # to actually delete
```

### 4. ℹ️ Font CSP Warning (Non-Critical)
**Problem**: External font blocked
```
Refused to load the font 'https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/fonts/FKGroteskNeue.woff2'
```

**Status**: This is expected behavior - external fonts are blocked for security. The app uses fallback fonts.

**Impact**: None - fallback fonts work correctly
