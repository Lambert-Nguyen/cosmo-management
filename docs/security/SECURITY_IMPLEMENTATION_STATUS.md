# 🔐 Security System Implementation Status

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive status update on the JWT authentication and security system implementation for the Cosmo backend application.

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. Core JWT Authentication System
- **Custom JWT Token Views** - Enhanced token generation with role-based claims
- **Token Ownership Verification** - Users can only revoke their own tokens (security fix)
- **Token Blacklisting** - Comprehensive token revocation (single and bulk)
- **Throttled Endpoints** - Rate limiting on all authentication endpoints

### 2. Security Models & Monitoring
- **UserSession Model** - Track active user sessions with device detection
- **SecurityEvent Model** - Log all authentication and security events
- **SuspiciousActivity Model** - Monitor and auto-block malicious behavior
- **Enhanced Security Middleware** - Request/response monitoring and threat detection

### 3. Security Dashboard (Implemented)
- **Real-time Dashboard** - Live security monitoring interface
- **Security Events API** - RESTful endpoints for security data
- **Session Management** - Admin can view and terminate user sessions
- **Security Analytics** - Trends and patterns analysis
- **Threat Detection** - Automatic suspicious activity detection

### 4. Rate Limiting & Throttling
- **Login Attempts**: 5/minute (prevents brute force)
- **Token Refresh**: 2/minute (reduced from 10/minute for better security)
- **Password Reset**: 3/hour
- **API Calls**: 1000/hour per user
- **Automatic Throttling**: DRF ScopedRateThrottle integration

### 5. Production Security Hardening
- **JWT Configuration Hardening**:
  - Access token lifetime: 30 minutes (reduced from 60 for security)
  - Separate JWT signing key from Django SECRET_KEY
  - Token rotation enabled with blacklisting
- **Security Headers**: Comprehensive security headers via middleware
- **AXES Integration**: Account lockout protection with modern settings
- **Email Configuration**: Consolidated and environment-driven

### 6. Testing & Validation
- **Comprehensive Test Suite** - Organized in `tests/security/`
- **Smoke Test Scripts** - Both basic and advanced validation scripts
- **Integration Tests** - End-to-end authentication flow testing
- **Documentation** - Complete API documentation and guides

## 🚀 Recent Fixes & Improvements

### Agent Recommendations Implemented

1. **✅ Token Ownership Verification**
   ```python
   # Added to revoke_token view
   if int(token['user_id']) != request.user.id:
       return Response({'error': 'Token does not belong to you'}, status=403)
   ```

2. **✅ Route Naming Clarity**
   - Changed `api-token-auth/` to `jwt-token-auth/` for clarity
   - Removed unused `obtain_auth_token` import

3. **✅ Settings Cleanup**
   - Fixed duplicate `from datetime import timedelta` imports
   - Consolidated email configuration to single source of truth
   - Updated deprecated AXES settings

4. **✅ Rate Limiting Optimization**
   - Reduced token refresh rate to 2/minute (more secure)
   - Maintained aggressive login rate limiting

5. **✅ AXES Configuration Update**
   - Fixed deprecated `AXES_LOCK_OUT_BY_COMBINATION_USER_AND_IP`
   - Updated to `AXES_LOCKOUT_PARAMETERS = ["ip_address", "username"]`

## 📊 System Status

### Current Configuration
```python
# JWT Security Settings
ACCESS_TOKEN_LIFETIME = 30 minutes  # Reduced for security
REFRESH_TOKEN_LIFETIME = 7 days
TOKEN_ROTATION = True
BLACKLIST_AFTER_ROTATION = True
SEPARATE_SIGNING_KEY = True

# Rate Limiting
LOGIN_RATE = "5/minute"
REFRESH_RATE = "2/minute"  # Improved from 10/minute
PASSWORD_RESET_RATE = "3/hour"

# Security Monitoring
AXES_FAILURE_LIMIT = 5
AXES_COOLOFF_TIME = 30 minutes
SECURITY_LOGGING = Comprehensive
```

### Test Results
```
🎯 JWT AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM TEST RESULTS
==========================================
✅ Token Generation: PASS

```

### Security Dashboard Features
- **Live Monitoring**: Real-time security event display
- **Session Management**: View and terminate active sessions
- **Threat Analytics**: IP blocking, failed login tracking
- **Event Filtering**: Filter by type, severity, time range
- **Admin Controls**: Superuser-only access with proper authentication

## 🛡️ Security Measures in Place

### Authentication Security
- JWT tokens with short expiration (30 min)
- Token blacklisting and rotation
- Ownership verification for all token operations
- Rate limiting on all auth endpoints

### Monitoring & Detection

- IP-based rate limiting and blocking
- Request/response monitoring middleware
- CORS configuration for API security

### Data Protection
- Separate JWT signing keys
- Environment-based configuration
- Secure password handling
- Session tracking with device detection
